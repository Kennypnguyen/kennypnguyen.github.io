      who has risen to fame and is now recognized <strong>globally</strong>. The
      Weeknd started off in the year 2011 releasing three mixtapes, which are
      now combined to be called <em>Trilogy</em>, and was quickly gaining
      traction because of the dark lyrics. Through the years, he has changed his
      style of music to more pop and new wave. Popular songs that include
      &quot;The Hills&quot;, &quot;Starboy&quot;, &quot;Can't Feel My
      Face&quot;, &quot;I Feel It Coming&quot;, and most notably &quot;Blinding
      Lights&quot;. As of 2022, with his recent albums <em>After Hours</em> and
      <em>Dawn FM</em>, he is now considered one of the
      <strong>top artists of this decade</strong>. Although some of his older
      fans wish for him to go back to his dark lyrics, they are still huge
      supporters and fans of The Weeknd as he continues to gain more fans.
